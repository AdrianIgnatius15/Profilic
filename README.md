### Node.JS REST API
#### REST API with Object Relational Mapping
This repository contains codes which constructs the REST API with a Object Relational Mapping using a library called "Moongoose".
To run this code as your REST API, follow the steps below.

1. Installing all dependencies and libaries required.
Run this command => `npm install`

2. Starting the REST API application
Run this command => `npm start`

#### What is "Moongoose"?
"Moongoose" is dependency or a library which forms what all modern Multi-page Applications and REST APIs require to communicate with the database without using any native SQL queries which in today's world is called "Object Relational Mapping" or ORM. This makes development faster by creating data models and using them as a representation of a table in the database.

The created models will then be added with properties which is contains constraints as it will represented as columns in the table in the database. Then, a repository is created to run queries to the database without using native SQL queries.
